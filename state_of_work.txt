The pipeline is working, ATE is too much for monocular
Check if it is due to orbslam or a configuration issue

    The method to get trajectory from orbslam cannot be used for TUM monocular case 
    Found this in a comment in the System.cc file
    probably that is the issue of large ATE Error

    But how do they show the position of camera in gui
    Is is updated after LBA and BA 
    Investigate

Should I run orbslam3 on replica dataset
Have to create config files for it
What else?

Can use TUM as RGBD for orbslam3 and Monogs
Both have the configuration and orbslam3 can be used to get trajectory


Something is wrong with the camera trajectory
It goes wild!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is it being optimized somewhere check it
is it some shitty transformation

Fixed the transformation, double check it
The frames for orbslam and MonoGs donot correspond,
Modify the dataset to get the color and depth paths with timestamps.
